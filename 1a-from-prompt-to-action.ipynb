      "*   **Wave-particle duality:** This principle states that quantum objects can exhibit characteristics of both waves and particles, depending on how they are observed. For example, electrons can behave as discrete particles or as waves, producing interference patterns in experiments like the double-slit experiment.\n",
      "*   **Quantization:** Many physical quantities, such as energy and momentum, are not continuous at the quantum level but exist in discrete, indivisible units called \"quanta\". Light, for instance, is transferred in packets of energy called photons.\n",
      "*   **Superposition:** Quantum particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until they are measured. This means a particle can be in various locations or have different properties at the same time.\n",
      "*   **Uncertainty Principle:** Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that there are fundamental limits to how precisely certain pairs of properties, like a particle's position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The more precisely one property is known, the less precisely the other can be determined.\n",
      "*   **Quantum Entanglement:** This occurs when two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that the state of one instantaneously influences the state of the others, regardless of the distance between them. Einstein famously described this as \"spooky action at a distance.\"\n",
      "*   **Spin:** This is an intrinsic property of elementary particles, similar to mass or charge, that influences their behavior and interactions. It's important to note that \"spin\" in quantum mechanics does not refer to a physical rotation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quantum physics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from experimental observations that classical physics could not explain, such as black-body radiation and the photoelectric effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "The principles of quantum physics have led to numerous practical applications that impact our daily lives, including:\n",
      "*   **Electronics:** Lasers, electron microscopes, transistors, diodes, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are all based on quantum mechanics.\n",
      "*   **Medical Imaging:** Technologies like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) utilize quantum principles to create detailed internal images of the human body.\n",
      "*   **Computing and Communication:** Quantum mechanics is the foundation for modern computing hardware and is driving the development of quantum computing and secure quantum communication.\n",
      "*   **Navigation Systems:** The extreme precision of atomic clocks, essential for GPS systems, relies on quantum properties of atoms.\n",
      "*   **Nanotechnology:** Quantum mechanics governs the behavior of matter at the nanoscale, enabling the development of new materials and devices.\n"
